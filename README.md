## GamePlace (465-project)
This is the repository for my 465-project: GamePlace. GamePlace is a game website that allows users to play online with others by creating lobbies with join codes. Currently Pong and Connect4 are supported games. Gameplace was implemented with React, Node.js, and Socket.io among other libraries.

### How to access the website
You can visit the deployed website at: https://gameplace.onrender.com/

You can also run the server locally by downloading the repository and switching to the server directory. You can then run either `npm run build-dev` or both `npm run pre-build` and `npm start` to start the server. Functionality that relies on environment variables (database and Google sign in) will not work without your own api keys.
